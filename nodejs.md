# nodejs

javascript was originally created by netscape for client side scripting within a sandbox in
a browser--this was the original purpose and intent.  it has since become a multipurpose
tool that can be leveraged on the server side for making things like cli tools and services
that, for example, access the file system which would have been a no-no for a web page.
it's still an interpreted language, but the interpreter is relatively high performing ever
since google came out with the v8 interpreter.
